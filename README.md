# Mr Donald's Crypto 101

## Purpose

To help teach investing in the world of crypto, this app allows a student to buy and trade various cryptocurrencies, starting with an imaginary $10,000.

Students will be able to buy Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Monero. In addition, they will be able to see an overview of their assets and be able to view current prices of each of these currencies.

## Next Steps

Given more time with this coding challenge, I would love to implement a better UI for creating orders. In addition, I would allow the user to dynamically add more altcoins to their portfolio.
